-# Warzone
 -Minehut's Warzone plugin supports tens of unique players on a monthly basis. It's modular design it to support one game-type on a per-map basis by restarting the server. 
 -
 -## Setup
 -Just run `mvn clean install` inside of the directory to build the project. We used Intellij to develop this plugin and strongly urge you too as well!
 -
 -## Code Style
 - we steal code
 -
 -## Things to note
 -1. Dev environments are currently not supported. I'l be adding an easy way to setup a test server soon.
